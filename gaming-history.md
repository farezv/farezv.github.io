I grew up playing cricket on the mean streets of Mumbai with very little exposure to video games. Then I moved to Canada in 2006 and had access to my first personal computer, a Toshiba A100-TA2. ![](http://knightrez.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/toshiba-a100-ta2.png)

Since the fall of 2006, I've mostly played first person shooters like Counter Strike, Battlefield, Call of Duty, Tribes Ascend, and Team Fortress 2. Ever since the DayZ mod was released, I've witnessed many digital betrayals.

I also enjoy third person action adventure games like the GTA series, Assassin's Creed, and sandbox/open world games like Skyrim and Minecraft (even though I spend more time tinkering with mods than I do playing Skyrim or Minecraft). I've started dabbling into indie titles ever since I found myself with more than 40 games purchased over 5-7 humble bundles.

I like telling stories, and sharing experiences I've had in different game worlds. Video game engines are fantastic pieces of software. How they emulate living worlds from strings of zeros and ones is mind-blowing. No other form of media has affected me in such a positive way. Games are the collective result of [incredible art](http://deadendthrills.com), complex systems and compelling stories. Not every game will tell you a good story, but those that do can leave you speechless.
