Hi, my name is Farez and I'm a comp sci grad and music enthusiast from Vancouver, Canada.

This blog will share and analyze my programming, music and video game related projects with the occasional personal post.

### Computer Science

After high school, I went to the University of British Columbia and initially had no idea what I wanted to do. After a few months of pursuing the idea of pharmacy school, I decided it wasn't for me. So I switched into the comp sci program during the summer of 2011 and haven't looked back.

I've completed courses in software engineering, computer systems and networks, algorithms and data structures, relational databases, with a sprinkle of graphics and AI.

### Work Experience

I started working when I was 15 and had a number of part time jobs throughout most of my high school and college life.

During university I interned at [Genesis Gaming](http://gen-game.com) and at [Citrix ShareFile](http://sharefile.com) and I've been working at Genesis full time since June 2015.

My professional programming experience spans Java, C#, TypeScript and Haxe and I try to keep up with the latest tech with my [side projects](http://farez.ca/projects.html) ("try" being the imperative word). I've also programmed in C and C++ before, for school projects. I'm positive I'd have no issues picking up new languages and frameworks to get the job done.

If my experience and skill set aligns well with an opportunity you know about, please get in touch via [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/farezv).

Thanks for stopping by!
