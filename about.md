Hi, my name is Farez and I'm a comp sci student and video game enthusiast from Vancouver, Canada.

This blog will share and analyze my programming and video game related projects with the occasional personal post.

### Computer Science

After high school, I went to the University of British Columbia and initially had no idea what I wanted to do. After a few months of pursuing the idea of pharmacy school, I decided it wasn't for me. So I switched into the comp sci program during the summer of 2011 and haven't looked back.

I've completed courses in software engineering, computer systems and networks, algorithms and data structures, relational databases, with a sprinkle of graphics and AI, and I'm looking forward to my last semester.

### Work Experience

I started working when I was 15 and had a number of part time jobs throughout most of my high school and college life.

Recently, I got some internship experience (in a small game studio and at Citrix ShareFile) and I'm actively seeking internship opportunities starting December 2014 or January 2015.

My "professional programming" experience only spans C# and TypeScript but I try to keep up with the latest technology trends in my [side projects](http://farez.ca/projects.html) and have programmed in Java, C, and C++ before. I'm positive I'd have no issues picking up new languages and frameworks to get the job done.

If my experience and skill set aligns well with an opportunity you know about, please get in touch via [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/farezv).

Thank you for reading!
