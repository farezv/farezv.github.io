Here are some of the 'demo-able' projects I've worked on. I have other app ideas (both web and mobile based) that'll hopefully show up here in the near future. All code resides on [GitHub](http://github.com/farezv).

## [Hublogs](http://hublogs.farezv.com)

I like reading developer blogs but searching through individual GitHub profiles, and organization member lists is tedious. Hublogs makes an attempt to solve this problem by showcasing developer profiles based on a GitHub user or organization search.

## [Steam Report Card](http://steamrc.herokuapp.com)

Project that consumes the Steam api to showcase a user's video game related data in a "report card" like manner (work in progress). Inspired by [The Open Source Report Card](http://osrc.dfm.io). Currently only shows basic profile data.

## [Sorting Library Call Numbers](http://sortsomething.appspot.com)

A Google Web Toolkit app that quizzes people on their library call number sorting. I implemented an unconventional string sorting algorithm to verify correct answers and to ensure I met UBC library's call number sorting scheme.
