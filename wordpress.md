I started a blog with WordPress.com back in 2011 and later bought my domain in 2012 but failed to realize that I didn't necessarily need a self hosted solution for a simple blog (unless I wanted extensive customization options). At the time, I wasn't aware of WordPress.com's <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/" target="_blank">Domain mapping service</a> so I ended up buying hosting from <a href="http://webhostinghub.com" target="_blank">WebHostinghub</a>. A year and $50 later I'm back on wp.com. However, I don't consider that a waste because I learned the process of getting a website up and running on a self hosted WordPress solution and all that goes into managing a website (backups, security etc.).

This knowledge led me to two projects:
<ul>
	<li>The redesign of <a href="http://KBMOD.com" target="_blank">KBMOD.com</a> (with 3 others), a PC gaming community I am now a part of</li>
	<li>The redesign of <a href="http://BHYVCblog.wordpress.com" target="_blank">BHYVC.com</a>, a volunteer group for a local hospital. This site used to live in an old HTML format and cost around $100+ annually to run (mostly due to hosting fees). It’s now freely hosted on WordPress.com and costs $26/year (including domain registration)</li>
</ul>
